## Min-Max Algorithm

In the min max algorithm in AI, there are two players, Maximiser and Minimiser. Both these players play the game as one tries to get the highest score possible or the maximum benefit while the opponent tries to get the lowest score or the minimum benefit.

## The steps for the min max algorithm in AI can be stated as follows:

Create the entire game tree.

Evaluate the scores for the leaf nodes based on the evaluation function.
Backtrack from the leaf to the root nodes:
For Maximizer, choose the node with the maximum score.

For Minimizer, choose the node with the minimum score.

At the root node, choose the node with the maximum value and select the respective move.
